>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
>I switched from another directory listing plugin to GeoDirectory a couple of weeks ago and I think I'm sticking with GD. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still moving up the learning curve, but I can see that GD could be a powerful plugin for what I'm trying to do. The support has been fantastic so far. The support team is very responsive and they really try to resolve any issues. They were already helpful answering support tickets that I raised even before I bought my GD membership.

>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
>Like many others I tried other plugins and even a listing theme, none gave me the options, flexibility and seamless integration with Elementor that GeoDirectory did. I worked with the free core GeoDirectory plugin for awhile (which did everything I needed it to) before I finally pulled the trigger and bought the membership giving me full access to all their add-ons and I'm so very happy I did! The add-ons will take your site to a whole new level. Support is simply the best. Fast, friendly and totally clear. You will never have to open another support ticket to explain the answer to the first √∞≈∏‚Ñ¢‚Äö GeoDirectory is absolutely brilliant!!

>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
>This is a truly amazing directory plugin. Very solid and extremely configurable. And the most important of all, it works with all themes with minimal css changes (or no changes at all). The free support offered here is fast and accurate. From the 4 plugins i tried, this is the only one that fulfilled my needs.

== ‚ö° FOR WHAT CAN I USE WORDPRESS BUSINESS DIRECTORY PLUGINS? ==

No matter what kind of business you're in, use our free WordPress directory plugin to turn your WordPress site into a powerful search engine for any domain:

* **Events Directory** GeoDirectory makes an excellent WordPress event calendar plugin by allowing people to submit listings of upcoming and ongoing events around the city in your directory theme.

* **Real Estate Directory** Have a real estate agency or website? Use one of the best real estate directory plugins to showcase your listings of houses, apartments, condos, and more. Manage agent profiles and property stats and display listings with beautiful image galleries.

* **Classifieds Ads Directory** Create a marketplace for classified ads with GeoDirectory. Let people submit ads to sell cars, find a job, or promote a service.

* **Jobs Directory** Use GeoDirectory to build a job board where businesses can post open positions, and people can search for employment.

* **Restaurants Directory** Create an online food directory highlighting the best restaurants around town and detailed menus and visitor reviews.

* **Hotels Directory** Use GeoDirectory to list and manage information about hotels, resorts, bed & breakfasts, and other types of accommodation.

* **Doctors Directory** Listing professionals with GeoDirectory is very easy. Create a directory of doctors and allow users to search them by speciality and proximity.  

* **Therapists Directory** Just like doctors, you can easily create a directory of Therapists. No matter if they are massage therapists or psychologists.  

* **Pets Directory** The pet industry is growing at unprecedented speed. Users need a directory to locate veterinarians, pet shops, pet groomers, pet parks and more.  

* **Church Directory** You can list churches, temples, religious retreats and events. Or create a directory of your church members.

* **Service Directory** A directory of freelancers for digital services similar to Fiverr or one for home service professionals like Angi.co or Homeadvisor.com

* **Travel Directory** If you live in a touristic area, list every attraction that a traveller could visit around your area and provide curated experiences.   

* **Hiking Trails Directory** This is a subset of a travel directory, but it can also attract local traffic. If hicking is your thing, consider becoming the online expert for this niche. 

* **Bars & Nightlife Directory** Another directory niche that can be very profitable and with very high traffic. Listing bars, clubs and discos in your local area can lead to sell tickets for happy hours, concerts, Dj Sets and much more. 

* **Software review sites** When the market leader becomes too big, they will be unbundled. Airbnb took over a Craiglist category with short term rentals. Capterra and Trustpilot are becoming huge and soon we will see more specialized software reviews directories. Why not starting yours? 

Because GeoDirectory allows you to create any listing's type, each with unique custom fields, you can use GeoDirectory for virtually any kind of directory.
