= READ WHAT USERS SAY ABOUT OUR WORDPRESS BUSINESS DIRECTORY PLUGIN =

>👉 __[Superb plugin!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/superb-plugin-410/)__
>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
>*Look no further than this plugin for a directory website, it’s fantastic. I looked at Directorist first and spent a good amount of time setting that up to find out their search function only checked the post title and >none of the tags or categories. Useless! GeoDirectory of course checks pretty much every field so your users can find every listing with ease.*
>
>*But that’s a relatively small plus point. The main selling point is the customization you can achieve. You can build your own layout using a page builder and insert the various fields wherever you see fit. It’s >so flexible and if you run into a support issue, the team are always on hand to help with responses in just a few hours (and at weekends).*

>*You will need to invest some money to buy all the necessary add-ons that make this plugin so powerful, and you will need to spend a good amount of time working out how to build it how you want it, but it’s well worth it, and the results speak for themselves.*
>
>*There is documentation to help you set everything up and I think the team will admit it does lack in places but when you get quick support responses, it’s not an issue.*
>
>*Overall this is the perfect choice if you’re thinking of building a directory site. No need to look elsewhere.*
>💁 mparsons501979 (@mparsons501979)

>👉 __[Unbelievable plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/unbelievable-plugin-11/)__
>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
>*This is the first business directory plugin I’ve ever used and I’m amazed about what it can do. I had reviewed several other directory plugins, but this one serves all of my purposes. There are so many options available for everything imaginable. They also have tons of add-ons to do even more that are part of the membership package I signed up for. Something like this normally would cost tens of thousands to have this much functionality. I highly recommend. Their customer service is very responsive as well and knowledgeable.*
